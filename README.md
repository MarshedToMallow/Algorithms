# FAQ

## There aren't a lot of programs yet, is this repo inactive?

Nope, it's just fairly new, so the index is still being initially filled.
Any contributions, especially this early on, are much appreciated.

## There's a program I want to add that isn't listed.  How can I get it added?

Go ahead and create an issue about the program, be sure to explain the specifics of what the program does and link any relevant material.

## I'd like to contribute something I made but I'm not sure how.

1) Go over to the **Fork** option just above the **About** section.
2) Create a fork.
3) Make your relevant changes to your fork.
4) Go to **Pull Requests** and create a **New Pull Request**.

Be sure to explain what changes you've made and why.

## I'd like to contribute but I'm not sure what.

I'd recommend looking through the list of issues to see if any catch your eye.

If not, look around at the different files and see if there's anything you think is missing.
Even if you don't feel like contributing it yourself, you could always create an issue to help someone else contribute it.

Additionally, feel free to look through the existing files and see if you feel like the code could be cleaned up.
Adding comments, clearing up variable names, and properly formatting the code can make a world of difference for anyone referencing it.

## How will my contributions be credited?

A full list of all the contributors will be available at the root directory's CREDITS.md along with shorter credits in the individual README.md files.
